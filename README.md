# 👋 Hey there, I’m Harsh Chitnis

I’m a first-year **Master’s student in Computer Science (Data Science & AI)** in Sweden.  
My interests lie at the intersection of **AI, image-based data, and autonomous systems** — combining analytics, perception, and problem-solving to create meaningful solutions.

---

## 🔭 What I’m Currently Exploring
- Image-based and signal-based data analysis using deep learning and computer vision  
- Building intelligent systems that learn from real-world sensory inputs  
- Expanding my understanding of AI-driven automation and control  

---

## 🧠 Past Work
Previously, I’ve worked on **avionics and autonomous control systems**, integrating hardware and software for data acquisition and system optimization.  
While I’m not actively building avionics hardware now, that experience shapes how I think about data, precision, and real-world performance.
